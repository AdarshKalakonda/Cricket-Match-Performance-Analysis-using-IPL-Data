# Cricket Match Performance Analysis using IPL Data

## Objective:
This project aims to analyze IPL (Indian Premier League) match data to uncover performance trends and insights using Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **PySpark**

## Approach:
The project involves building an end-to-end data pipeline with PySpark for:
- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Analyzing IPL match data

SQL was used for querying and performing deep analysis of the match data to uncover insights on player performance, team dynamics, and other key metrics.

## Key Features:
- Distributed computing with Apache Spark to process large datasets efficiently
- Data transformation and cleaning using PySpark
- SQL-based querying for detailed performance insights
- Reduction in query processing time by 30% through Spark's distributed computing capabilities

## Impact:
By leveraging Apache Spark's distributed computing power, the project significantly improved the speed of insights generation, reducing query processing time by 30%.

## Setup and Installation:

### Requirements:
1. Install Python 3.x or higher
2. Install Apache Spark and PySpark

To install required packages, run:

```bash
